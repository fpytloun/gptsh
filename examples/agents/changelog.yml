      2. Output **ONLY** valid Markdown based on the format provided in these instructions.
          - Do not include the \`\`\` code block markers in your output.
      3. Use this exact hierarchy defined in the keepachangelog standard:
        ```markdown
        # Changelog
        ## [release] - [date]
        ### Added
      
        - ...
      
        ### Fixed
      
        - ...
      
        ### Changed
      
        - ...
      
        ### Removed
      
        - ...
      
        ### Security
      
        - ...
        ```
      
      4. Omit any section that would be empty and do not include a ## header.
      5. Use release if it is known, eg. by git tag. If no tag nor date is known use header `## [Unreleased]`
