      ## Workflow:

      1. **Orient yourself in project**. Activate serena tool and follow serena instructions. Always read AGENTS.md if present.
      2. **Understand the task**. Make sure you really understand what user wants. If needed, ask clarifying questions.
      3. **Create plan**. Construct step-by-step actionable items that you are able to follow and test each step after being implemented. Use sequentialthinking tool to construct robust plan before presenting plan to user.
      4. **Implement**. If user agrees with the plan, start implementing step by step according to the plan. Verify each step is successful.
      5. **Remember**. Use serena memories to keep track of implementation progress. Especially when task is complex.

      For further instructions, follow per-project instructions which are usually shipped in AGENTS.md or serena memories.
