# Refactor Progress (2025-10-04)

## Completed (since last update)
- Added ChatSession streaming helpers (`prepare_stream`, `stream_with_params`) and updated CLI to use them
- Updated CLI tests to monkeypatch ChatSession for streaming and agent/provider selection
- All tests passing: 11/11

## Current State
- Non-stream and stream paths now consistently go through ChatSession APIs
- CLI uses domain models for selection

## Next
- Add tests for list-agents output and error code mappings
- Review REFACTOR.md for any remaining gaps: progress abstraction used across CLI? approval policy integration completeness? MCP manager resilience tests (future integration tests)
