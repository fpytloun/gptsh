# Refactor Progress (2025-10-04)

## Completed (since last update)
- Integrated domain models into CLI for agent/provider selection (gptsh/cli/entrypoint.py)
- Added CLI test for agent/provider selection (gptsh/tests/test_cli_entrypoint.py)
- Test suite now: 11 passing tests

## Current State
- Modular interfaces + adapters + ChatSession in place
- CLI lists tools and runs prompts; tool flows use ChatSession
- Domain models drive selection logic in CLI

## Next
- Optional: unify streaming path via ChatSession-like streaming helper
- Add more tests: error codes mapping, approvals denied exit code, and list-agents output
- Continue refactor per REFACTOR.md: progress abstraction across CLI and session
