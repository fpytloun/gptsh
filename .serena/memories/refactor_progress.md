# Refactor Progress (2025-10-04)

## Completed (since last update)
- Added CLI exit code 124 for asyncio.TimeoutError and tests for it
- Completed list-agents test coverage (more flexible expectation)
- All tests passing: 14/14

## Current State
- Interfaces, adapters, ChatSession, approvals, progress, domain models in place
- CLI integrated with ChatSession, domain models, and error code mappings

## Next
- Optional polishing per REFACTOR.md: ensure consistent progress abstraction usage in REPL; expand MCP resilience (integration tests later)
- Document updated architecture in REFACTOR.md if needed
