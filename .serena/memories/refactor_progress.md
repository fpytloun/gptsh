# Refactor Progress (2025-10-04)

## Completed (since last update)
- Switched CLI to use `RichProgressReporter` abstraction for both streaming and non-stream flows
- Kept all tests green: 14/14

## Current State
- Architecture aligned with REFACTOR.md: interfaces, session orchestrator, MCP manager, approvals, progress abstraction, domain models, and CLI integration.
- CLI exit codes: 0,1,4,124,130 covered; tests for 4 and 124 included.

## Next
- Optional: add more integration tests around MCP server lifecycle (spawn/reconnect) â€” likely out-of-scope for this unit-test slice.
- Consider updating REFACTOR.md to reflect completed items and remaining future work.
